# LavaScript

A lispy language that compiles into JavaScript.

## Try LavaScript

You can now [try LavaScript in your web-browser](http://rocketnia.kodingen.com/af/try-lava-script/). Many thanks to [Ross Angle](http://www.rocketnia.com/) (a.k.a. rocketnia) for implementing this!! He has also made the source code [available](https://gist.github.com/837840).

## Todo

LavaScript is incomplete. It still needs:

- rest parameters and unquote-splicing
- better reader (support strings!)
- npm packaging
- syntactic conveniences (like the dot operator)
- pretty-printed output
- idiomatic output (semi-colon instead of comma)
